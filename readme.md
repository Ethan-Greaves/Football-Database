# The Football Database

The Football Database is a web application created using Node.js/Express. Users can search for any football team or player and a fetch request is made to [The Sports DB API](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php) to give back information. An authentication system was also created using [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/) which allows users to login and add favourites which appears on the home page.
